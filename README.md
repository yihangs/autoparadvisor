This repo contains the trained parameter advisor models for Scallop and StringTie. For details on these models, please read our manuscript "Adaptive, sample-specific parameter selection for more accurate transcript assembly". 

Here we provide an example of generating a parameter advisor set for a new RNA-seq sample via our model.
